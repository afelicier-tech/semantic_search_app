Semantic Search App for Aesthetic Social Post

A semantic search app allows users to search text or content based on meaning rather than exact keywords. In this app, text data (like Instagram captions or treatment descriptions) is split into manageable chunks, converted into vector embeddings using a language model, and stored in a vector database (Pinecone). When a user queries the app, the query is also embedded, and the database returns the most semantically similar content, enabling intelligent, context-aware search results.
